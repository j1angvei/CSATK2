## Warning 
This project is deprecated!!!

## How to compile 
1. Download and unzip the source code.
2. Run `./gradlew jar`(unix based OS) or `gradlew.bat jar`(windows, not tested).
3. The jar file is located at `./build/libs/CSATK2-yyMMdd.jar`. 

## Introduction
CSATK is Java written bio-informatics software, the main goal of CSATK is to make ChIP-Seq analysis easier and more efficient.  

By integrating common used bio-informatics software and website such as FastQC, BWA, SAMTools, Qualimap, MACS2, Homer and Panther, CSATK can not only run a ChIP-Seq analysis pipeline, but also run single function or multiple functions in order.   

How to make it work? All you have to is create a **input.json** config file to tell CSATK your raw FASTQ data and relevant genome information.  

CSATK has following advantages:
1. High efficiency. Once the analysis starts, ChIP-Seq pipeline can automatically start next step without further command.  
2. Low error rate. Since all commands are generated by CSATK, there won't be any rookie mistake.  
3. Multiple functions. CSATK can do alignment, quality control, peak calling and so on,due to its integrating with the bio-informatics software mentioned above.  
4. Easy to use. CSATK has both command line support and GUI support for some functions.

## Tutorial
### How to download and use CSATK
1. Download CSATK compressed file, [CSATK2 release page](https://github.com/j1angvei/CSATK2/releases);
2. Unzip the .tgz file, run `java -jar CSATK.jar -r` to restore CSATK structure;
3. Run `java -jar CSATK.jar -i` to install all relevant software(FastQC, BWA, SAMTools, etc.);
4. Place your raw data under **input** folder, genome reference file and annotation under **genome** folder;
5. Create your **input.json** file and put it under **config** folder (there is a template of input.json under the same folder);
6. Start the ChIP-Seq pipeline by running `java -jar CSATK.jar -p`.

#### Tips:   
When execute CSATK2.jar with `java -jar CSATK2.jar`, but a error message showed up like <strong>Error occurred during initialization of VM</strong>, this is because JVM can not get enough RAM.
  
To resolve this error, add `-Xmx256M` to execute the Jar file,for example `java -Xmx256M CSATK2.jar`. Beware this will limit CSATK to use only 256M RAM doing analysis. You can increase to 1024 or higher.As explained [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html):  

    -Xmxn
    Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration.
    
    For server deployments, -Xms and -Xmx are often set to the same value.
    
    Examples:
    
    -Xmx83886080
    -Xmx81920k
    -Xmx80m 

 
### How to create your own **input.json** file

If you are familiar with [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format, you can create it very easily using VIM (Linux) or Notepad (Windows). And all you need to is modify the input.json template in **config** folder.    

In case you have no idea what JSON format is or you just don't want to write the boilerplate, CSATK can help you create the input.json file, just double click the JAR file or run `java -jar CSATK.jar`.    

Under any environment with X Display support(such as Windows, MACS or Ubuntu Desktop) and at least [JRE 8] is installed (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)(JDK 8 is the same since JDK contains JRE), you can start CSATK GUI to help you create input.json.  

Here is a simple illustration of using CSATK GUI to create input.json:
1. Launch CSATK GUI by double clicking CSATK.jar or running `java -jar CSATK.jar` from console(Notice that only X display support devices can open CSATK GUI).  
2. Add all genome items in the table (you may need to remove the sample genome item).  
<img src='./raw/all_genomes_text.png'/>  
3. If you have many genome items which is very similar, you can copy it and then edit.  
<img src='./raw/edit_genome_text.png'/>  
4. Add all experiment items in the table (remember to remove the sample item).  
<img src='./raw/all_experiments_text.png'/>  
5. Edit the experiment item and check if something is wrong.  
<img src='./raw/edit_experiment_text.png'/>  
6. Click _Generate_ button, a **input.json** will be created under the same location where you put the CSATK.jar.  
<img src='./raw/generate_success_text.png'/>  

## Tips
1. If you met problem like <strong>Error occurred during initialization of VM</strong>, you can solve this by adding parameter`-Xmx256M`, for example `java -Xmx256M -jar CSATK.jar`.  

2. Since GO & Pathway needs network connection, you better check the computed nodes are available connecting to network.
